    - Filtering for specific trace levels
    - More messages
- Add timestamps to chat messages
- Popup support
- Audio
    - Simple audio recording
    - Variable bitrate
        - Change in settings
- Ping and speed/bandwidth detection
- Number of wakeups/packets/data /s
    - Custom audio hooking into applications
- Chat messages fix min
- Test if next_resendable() actually works correctly
- Remove disconnected peers
    - Detect if UDP connections get disconnected
        - Maybe after 5 lost packets?
- Audio maybe add packet loss detection (fec in opus)
- TUI settings tab
    - Audio options
        - Input device
        - Output device
        - Bitrate
        - Noise cancelling
- Split TUI into smaller chunks
- Send udp announce after disconnecting and reconnecting 
from and to the rendezvous server

ARCHITECTURE
-----------

UDP messages

- Split full message into multiple smaller parts
- Reliable and unreliable message types
- Message id
    - Incremented every message
    - Different on every peer

CLIENT

- Threading: 3 channels
    - IO Networking Thread
    - GUI Thread
    - FFMPEG Thread(s)
    - Wakeup Thread for IO

    Channels:

    - GUI to IO
    - IO to GUI
    - FFMPEG to IO
    - GUI to FFMPEG

UDP Hole Punching:
    - C1 calls C2 VIA server
    - C1 starts sending packets to server through UDP
    - C2 picks up
    - C2 start sending packet to server through UDP
    - server informs both C1 and C2 
    that they can start connecting

    - C1 starts sending packets to C2
    - C2 starts sending packets to C1

    - Connection established
